Improving the accessibility of HTML involves implementing practices and techniques that ensure all users, including those with disabilities, can access and interact with web content. Here are three ways to enhance HTML accessibility:

1. **Semantic HTML:**
   - Use semantic HTML elements to provide meaning and structure to the content. Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` help convey the document's structure, making it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret and present information accurately.

     Example:
     ```html
     <header>
         <h1>Website Title</h1>
         <nav>
             <ul>
                 <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                 <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
                 <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
             </ul>
         </nav>
     </header>
     <main>
         <article>
             <h2>Article Title</h2>
             <p>Content of the article...</p>
         </article>
     </main>
     <footer>
         <p>&copy; 2023 Website Name</p>
     </footer>
     ```

2. **Provide Alternative Text for Images:**
   - Include descriptive alternative text for images using the `alt` attribute. This text is read aloud by screen readers and provides context for users who cannot see the images. Avoid leaving the `alt` attribute empty unless the image is purely decorative.

     Example:
     ```html
     <img src="example.jpg" alt="A descriptive text of the image">
     ```

3. **Proper Use of Headings:**
   - Use heading elements (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to create a hierarchical structure for your content. Headings help users, especially those with screen readers, understand the organization and flow of information on the page. Avoid skipping heading levels, as it can create confusion.

     Example:
     ```html
     <h1>Main Heading</h1>
     <p>Introduction to the content...</p>
     
     <h2>Subheading 1</h2>
     <p>Content of subheading 1...</p>
     
     <h2>Subheading 2</h2>
     <p>Content of subheading 2...</p>
     ```

These practices not only improve accessibility but also contribute to better SEO and overall user experience. Continuously testing and validating your website with accessibility tools and guidelines, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), will further ensure that your HTML is accessible to a diverse range of users.
