HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides a structure for the content on the web. Here are some key features of HTML:

1. Markup Tags:
   - HTML uses markup tags to define elements on a web page.
   - Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`), and most come in pairs (opening and closing tags).

2. Document Structure:
   - HTML documents have a basic structure with an opening `<html>` tag and closing `</html>` tag.
   - The document is typically divided into a `<head>` section and a `<body>` section.

3. Head Section:
   - Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title, character set, linked stylesheets, and scripts.
   - Uses tags like `<title>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`, and `<script>`.

4. Body Section:
   - Contains the main content of the web page.
   - Utilizes various tags for text, images, links, lists, forms, and more.

5. Text Formatting:
   - HTML provides tags for text formatting, including headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), emphasis (`<em>` and `<strong>`), and line breaks (`<br>`).

6. Lists:
   - Ordered lists (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`) are supported, with list items marked by `<li>`.

7. Links:
   - Hyperlinks are created using the `<a>` (anchor) tag. The `href` attribute specifies the URL.

8. Images:
   - Images are included using the `<img>` tag, with the `src` attribute pointing to the image file.

9. Forms:
   - HTML supports forms for user input, created with the `<form>` tag. Form elements include input fields (`<input>`), buttons (`<button>`), dropdowns (`<select>`), and more.

10. Tables:
    - Tables are constructed using the `<table>` tag, with rows defined by `<tr>` and cells by `<td>` (data cell) or `<th>` (header cell).

11. Semantic Elements:
    - HTML5 introduced semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and `<aside>` to provide more meaning to the structure.

12. Comments:
    - Comments in HTML are enclosed within `<!--` and `-->` and are used to provide information to developers without affecting the page's display.

13. Attributes:
    - HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information or settings. For example, the `class` and `id` attributes are commonly used for styling and JavaScript.

14. Doctype Declaration:
    - The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration specifies the HTML version being used and helps browsers render the page correctly.

15. Inline and Block Elements:
    - Elements are categorized as inline or block-level. Inline elements don't start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary, while block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available.

These features collectively define the structure, presentation, and behavior of web content using HTML.
